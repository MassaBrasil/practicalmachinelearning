Peer-graded Assignment: Prediction Assignment Writeup


## Summary

We live in an age that means to collect large amound of data about specific observations such personal activities are availabe to average people - Using devices available for purchasing such as JawboneUp, NikeFuelBand, and Fitbitit (or further devices) and   relatively inexpensive budget. We have available data collected on study that aimed to quantify movement of some volunteers, enthusiasts that have taken measures regularly and to analyze them,aiming to find clues for health improvement, by finding  patterns. A distinct aspect of this project is to focus the point people usually does not pay attention - instead of quantifying a particular activity they do, it focuses in quantifying how well they do it.

This project used data from `accelerometers` on the `belt`, `forearm`, `arm`, and `dumbell` of 6 participants; they performed barbell lifts - correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. 

More information is available from the [website](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) (see details in the section on the 'Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset').

## Data availability - and acknowledgements

As asked by this project - "If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment", we support this request and also appreciate the opportunity to share it for our study.

## Practical Machine Learning - what is requested to be submitted 

"Goal: to predict the manner exercse has been done. 

(This is the "classe" variable in the training set). 

- other variables can be used to predict it. 

- create a report describing : 

 - how you built your model,  
 
 - how you used cross validation, 
 
 - what you think the expected out of sample error is, and 
 
 - why you made the choices you did. 

Use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases. 

Peer Review Portion - Your submission for the Peer Review portion

- it should consist of a link to a Github repo with 
   your R markdown and compiled HTML file describing your analysis. 
   
- text: writeup < 2000 words, # of figures: less than 5. 

(make it easier for the graders by submiting repo with gh-pages branch so HTML page can be viewed online - always aim to make it easy on graders)

Course Project Prediction Quiz Portion:

- apply your machine learning algorithm to the 20 test cases available in the test data above 

- submit your predictions in appropriate format to the Course Project Prediction Quiz for automated grading."


## HTML report (under gh-pages branch) 

Open this GitHub link [http://massabrasil.github.io/practicalmachinelearning/](http://massabrasil.github.io/practicalmachinelearning/).  

HTML file: found under `gh-pages` branch.
